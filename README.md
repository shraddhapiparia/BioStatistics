# BioStatistics
A repository with commands for implementation in R.
The first part of the repository has commands that introduces the fundamentals of statistical inference: summarizing and visualizing data, probability, normal and binomial distribution, sampling, central limit theorem, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing. 
The second part of the repository contains the commands for most commonly used analyses for continuous (scale) and binary response variables in the case of one-, two-, and three or more groups. 
The statistical methods will include independent samples and paired samples t-tests, tests based on ranks, Pearson’s chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests for binary variables, paired tests for continuous and binary variables, one-way ANOVA, correlation, and simple linear regression.
