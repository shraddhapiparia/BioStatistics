# BioStatistics
### A repository with commands for implementation in R.
### The basic commands in Resources folder has commands that introduces the fundamentals of statistical inference: summarizing and visualizing data, probability, normal and binomial distribution, sampling, central limit theorem, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing. 
### The Statistical tests file in Resources contains the commands for most commonly used statistical analyses for continuous (scale) and binary response variables in the case of one-, two-, and three or more groups. The statistical methods will include independent samples and paired samples t-tests, tests based on ranks, Pearson’s chi-square and Fisher’s exact tests for binary variables, paired tests for continuous and binary variables, one-way ANOVA, correlation, and simple linear regression.
### The models file in Resources includes more advanced regression-based statistical analyses, including: simple linear regression and correlation analysis; multiple linear regression; logistic regression; Cox proportional hazards models.
### Examples has data and corresponding R code for analysis.
